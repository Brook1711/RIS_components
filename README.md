# What this project aims ?
This project aims to redo the simulations shown in the paper below [Link to this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15154):
> Zhang, Zijian, et al. "Active RIS vs. Passive RIS: Which Will Prevail in 6G?." arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.15154 (2021).

Specifically, in this project we will simulate the active RIS. And to maximum the universality, this project will provide modular simulation tool for RIS-aided system.
